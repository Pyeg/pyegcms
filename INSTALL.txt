General:
The content managment system is based on a Djangoproject called "django-cms"
To setup the environment, setuptools and virtualenv must be installed on your system. 

Mostly "setuptools" is already installed on your linux system or look in your repository to check out. 

In case that "setuptools" is not available for your distro, install it manually (as root):

wget https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/raw/bootstrap/ez_setup.py -O - | python


VirtualEnv:
A virtual environment is a way to run python scripts and installation seperated from a global system. 
This is often useful for seperate projects and that libraries won't affect global installations. 

More information:
http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/


(as root) pip install virtualenv


Creating and entering the environment:

(as user)
