These are the steps that we will follow to install the website.

1. Download & install [Pillow](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pillow/2.3.0). Choose the version compatible with your operating system & Python version, e.g. if you are running Python 2.7 on Windows, choose `Pillow-2.3.0.win32-py2.7.exe`.
2. Download & install pip by following [these installation instructions](http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html).
